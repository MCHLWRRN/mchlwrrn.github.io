In 1998, I build my first website at the Univeristy of Michigan's Ace Computer Camp

In 2008, I graduated from Michigan State University and began my career in sales.

In 2011, I started internet marketing with Amazon Affiliates and Wordpress niche sites.

In 2014, I learned how to use Facebook to successfully advertise Teespring campaigns.

In 2015, I completed a Ruby on Rails apprenticeship and I am currently seeking projects.

I built this site using
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator built on Ruby.
